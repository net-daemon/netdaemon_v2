This is the V2 version of NetDaemon. For most reasent V3 version please goto [netdaemon v3 repo](/net-daemon/netdaemon)
We will do bugfixes and and maintain v2 releases but new features will be added to V3 version. Thank you for your understanding that building maintainable software sometimes makes you need to do breaking changes to be able to maintain software on a free time basis. We recomend you adopt your apps to V3 when it is released sometime early 2022.
